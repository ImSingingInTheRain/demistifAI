# Model Card — demistifAI (Spam Detector)
**Intended purpose**: Educational demo to illustrate the AI Act definition of an **AI system** via a spam classifier.

**Algorithm**: {algo}  
**Features**: Sentence embeddings (MiniLM) concatenated with small, interpretable numeric features:
- num_links_external, has_suspicious_tld, all_caps_ratio, punct_burst_ratio, money_symbol_count, urgency_terms_count.
These are standardized and combined with the embedding before a linear classifier.

**Classes**: spam, safe  
**Dataset size**: {n_samples} labeled examples  
**Classes present**: {', '.join(labels_present) if labels_present else '[not trained]'}

**Key metrics**: {metrics_text or 'Train a model to populate metrics.'}

**Autonomy**: {ss['autonomy']} (threshold={ss['threshold']:.2f})  
**Adaptiveness**: {'Enabled' if ss['adaptive'] else 'Disabled'} (learn from user corrections).

**Data**: user-augmented seed set (title + body); session-only.  
**Known limitations**: tiny datasets; vocabulary sensitivity; no MIME/URL/metadata features.

**AI Act mapping**  
- **Machine-based system**: Streamlit app (software) running on cloud runtime (hardware).  
- **Inference**: model learns patterns from labeled examples.  
- **Output generation**: predictions + confidence; used to recommend/route emails.  
- **Varying autonomy**: user selects autonomy level; at full autonomy, the system acts.  
- **Adaptiveness**: optional feedback loop that updates the model.
